      <p>Toxic chemicals have unexpectedly been present in our daily life, in our daily-use products, in more ways than we had imagined before, but many of us are still unaware that we are absorbing untested and unsafe chemicals in our products. Exposure to harmful products is inevitable in today’s world, but the lack of transparency and action from the FDA in regards to the cosmetic industry is deeply concerning, and we are more than deserving to receive a real cosmetics safety reform.</p>
      <p>I’ll start off by comparing the cosmetic industries of the US and EU: in cosmetics alone, the EU has banned or restricted more than 1,300 chemicals while the US has outlawed or curbed just 11. For example, it’s possible to find formaldehyde, a known carcinogen banned in EU-sold cosmetics, in US hair-straightening treatments and nail polish. Parabens, linked to reproductive problems, are ruled out in the EU but not the US, where they lurk in skin and hair products. Coal tar dyes can be found in Americans’ eyeshadow, years after they were banned in the EU and Canada.</p>
      <p>In the US there is strong favoritism towards companies and manufacturers, to the extent that public health and the environment are being harmed. According to a statement from the FDA itself, there are currently no legal requirements in the US for any cosmetic manufacturer marketing products to American consumers to test their products for safety, meaning that ultimately a cosmetic manufacturer can decide if they’d like to test their product for safety and register it with the FDA or not. What could be even more shocking is that the provisions in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) — the law governing the FDA’s oversight of cosmetic products — have not been updated since it was first enacted in 1938. Clearly the federal government is barely functioning, so we as consumers have to realize that we have the power to become more vocal and demand change. With citizens becoming more vocal, and the Clean Beauty Movement gaining more traction, the pendulum is now swinging in an extreme way and hopefully — with our contributions — is going to take a general awakening by the public.</p>
      <p>I would like to recommend everyone to watch the “Not So Pretty” documentary on HBOMax that explores the beauty industry and hidden chemicals in products. It was very shocking and eye-opening and has influenced me to become more aware and careful of the products I’m using in my daily life.</p>
